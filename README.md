This repository contains supplementary files - synthetic data, code, results of running mutational-signature
discovery programs, and analysis of their results - 
for the paper

See https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp and https://github.com/steverozen/hdpx for `mSigHdp`.

### Directory structure

The top-level directories are:

#### Directory `common_code`

This directory contains

- Code used by other code in the `code` subdirectories of the directories containing the main datasets and results.

- Code to generate initial versions of tables and figures in the paper.
  
- Some subdirectories for particular analyses, which sometimes contain initial versions of tables or figures in the paper.

#### Directory `output_for_paper`

This directory contains output from code in `common_code` that is used in the paper.

#### Multiple directories containing main datasets and results

These contain the results of running the mutational signature discovery programs, and usually the input data.

- `indel_set1`, `indel_set2`,
   `SBS_set1` and `SBS_set2` are the main synthetic data sets as documented in the paper.

-  `indel_set1_down_samp`, `indel_set2_down_samp`, `SBS_set1_down_samp` and
   `SBS_set2_down_samp` contain
   results of running mSigHdp with different downsampling thresholds
   on the synthetic data in `indel_set1`, `indel_set2`, `SBS_set1`, and `SBS_set2`.
   (The `â€¦down_samp` folders use the corresponding original datasets, e.g. `indel_set1_down_samp` uses the same data as `indel_set1`.)
   
- `sens_SBS35_x_728` and `sens_SBS35_x_1066` Data with SBS35
  "spiked into" x (the number of) tumors; see Supplementary Figure S10 of the paper.
  `728` and `1066` refer to arbitrary random seeds.
